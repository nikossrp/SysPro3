# SysPro3
CyclicBuffer is a simple shared structure that will store files for the threads. Each thread gets a file from cyclicbuffer and inserts entries into the vaccineMonitor/project1 dataset.
I'm using sockets for the communication between processes, everything else is the same as the SysPro2, .
